## Getting and Cleaning Data.
====

How run_analysis.R works:

* Loads libraries and functions.
* downloads the dataset and unzips.
* Reads in the data.
* Extracts relevant data.
* Transforms data (see codebook.md for transformations).
* Creates secondary tidy dataset.
* Creates codebook.txt with info about the tidy dataset.

Comments in run_analysis.r clarify each step taken.
